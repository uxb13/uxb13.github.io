## AI to solve the 2048 puzzle using adversial search
2048 is a popular sliding-block puzzle. We will attempt to develop heuristics to play the 2048 game. The heuristics will be used with Minimax search to solve the puzzle and maximize the score. 

### Approach
The idea is to optimize the weights for different features of the game and hopefully maximize the score. This is achieved by playing many games and using a derivative-free optimization technique to select suitable weights.

### anticipated results
We expect the score to improve after many iterations and the AI to perform reasonably well.
